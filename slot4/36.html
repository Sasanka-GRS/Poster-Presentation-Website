                  <p class="text-white" >The COVID-19 pandemic severely changed the way of life in the United States (US). From early scattered regional outbreaks to current country-wide spread, and from rural areas to highly populated cities, the contagion exhibits diverse patterns at various timescales and locations. We thus conduct a graph frequency analysis to inves- tigate the spread patterns of COVID-19 in different US counties. </p>
                
                <p class="text-white" >The commute flows between all 3142 US counties were used to construct a graph capturing the population mobility. The numbers of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases per county were collected and represented as graph signals, which were then mapped into the frequency domain via the graph Fourier transform. The concept of graph frequency in Graph Signal Processing (GSP) enables the decomposition of graph signals (i.e., daily confirmed cases) into modes with smooth or rapid variations with respect to the underlying mobility graph. </p>
                    
                <p class="text-white" >These different modes of variability are shown to relate to COVID-19 spread patterns within and across counties. Changes in the nature of spread within geographical regions are also revealed by graph frequency analysis at finer temporal scales. Overall, our GSP-based approach leverages case count and mobility data to unveil spatio-temporal contagion patterns of COVID-19 incidence for each US county. Results here support the promising prospect of using GSP tools for epidemiology knowledge discovery on graphs.</p>
