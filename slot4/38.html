                  <p class="text-white" >Modern neuroimaging techniques provide us with
                    unique views on brain structure and function; i.e., how the brain
                    is wired, and where and when activity takes place. Data acquired
                    using these techniques can be analyzed in terms of its network
                    structure to reveal organizing principles at the systems level. Graph
                    representations are versatile models where nodes are associated
                    to brain regions and edges to structural or functional connections.
                    </p>
                
                <p class="text-white" >Structural graphs model neural pathways in white matter, which
                    are the anatomical backbone between regions. Functional graphs
                    are built based on functional connectivity, which is a pairwise
                    measure of statistical interdependency between pairs of regional
                    activity traces. Therefore, most research to date has focused on
                    analyzing these graphs reflecting structure or function. Graph
                    signal processing (GSP) is an emerging area of research where
                    signals recorded at the nodes of the graph are studied atop the
                    underlying graph structure. An increasing number of fundamental
                    operations have been generalized to the graph setting, allowing
                    to analyze the signals from a new viewpoint. </p>
                    
                <p class="text-white" >Here, we review GSP
                    for brain imaging data and discuss their potential to integrate
                    brain structure, contained in the graph itself, with brain function,
                    residing in the graph signals. We review how brain activity can
                    be meaningfully filtered based on concepts of spectral modes

                    derived from brain structure. We also derive other operations
                    such as surrogate data generation or decompositions informed
                    by cognitive systems. In sum, GSP offers a novel framework for
                    the analysis of brain imaging data.</p>
