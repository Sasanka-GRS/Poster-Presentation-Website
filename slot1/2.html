                  <p class="text-white" >A new method for estimating the fundamental
                    frequencies of concurrent musical sounds is described. The
                    method is based on an iterative approach, where the fundamental
                    frequency of the most prominent sound is estimated, the sound
                    is subtracted from the mixture, and the process is repeated for
                    the residual signal. For the estimation stage, an algorithm is proposed which utilizes the frequency relationships of simultaneous
                    spectral components, without assuming ideal harmonicity. </p>
                  
                  <p class="text-white" >For the
                    subtraction stage, the spectral smoothness principle is proposed
                    as an efficient new mechanism in estimating the spectral envelopes
                    of detected sounds. With these techniques, multiple fundamental
                    frequency estimation can be performed quite accurately in a
                    single time frame, without the use of long-term temporal features.
                    The experimental data comprised recorded samples of 30 musical
                    instruments from four different sources. 
                    </p>
                  
                  <p class="text-white" >Multiple fundamental
                    frequency estimation was performed for random sound source and
                    pitch combinations. Error rates for mixtures ranging from one to
                    six simultaneous sounds were 1.8%, 3.9%, 6.3%, 9.9%, 14%, and
                    18%, respectively. In musical interval and chord identification
                    tasks, the algorithm outperformed the average of ten trained
                    musicians. The method works robustly in noise, and is able to
                    handle sounds that exhibit inharmonicities. The inharmonicity
                    factor and spectral envelope of each sound is estimated along with
                    the fundamental frequency.</p>
