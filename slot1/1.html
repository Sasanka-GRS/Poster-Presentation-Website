                  <p class="text-white" >â€”Multirate filter banks make use of analysis and
                    synthesis filter banks. This paper introduces two-channel digital
                    and hybrid analog/digital multirate filter banks where either the
                    analysis or synthesis filters have a very low complexity. Such
                    filter banks find application, for example, in high-speed analog-to
                    digital converters where it is essential to minimize the complexity
                    of the discrete-time or analog filters. </p>
                  
                  <p class="text-white" >IThe proposed digital filter
                    banks are approximately perfect reconstruction (PR) filter banks,
                    whereas the hybrid analog/digital filter banks can be chosen to
                    be either approximately PR or approximately perfect magnitude
                    reconstruction filter banks. The design is performed by first
                    optimizing the digital or analog analysis filters and then, with
                    the analysis filters fixed, optimizing the digital synthesis filters.
                    </p>
                  
                  <p class="text-white" >This design procedure makes it possible to obtain analysis filters
                    of very low order and complexity. The overall complexity is also
                    low. Further, the proposed filter banks are, in all cases, very easy
                    to design by making use of well-known and reliable optimization
                    techniques; in particular, as small distortion and aliasing as
                    desired are readily obtained because they are controlled in a linear
                    programming problem. Several design examples are included,
                    illustrating the properties of the proposed filter banks.</p>
